## Version 1.13.0 (2025-07-06)

### Editor
Does not require the .NET SDK for NuGet and Publish. If it isn't installed, automatically downloads (~26 MB) and uses a minimal SDK.

Removed the " C#" from the full name of the program. Now just "LibreAutomate".

Several improvements.

### Library
No changes
