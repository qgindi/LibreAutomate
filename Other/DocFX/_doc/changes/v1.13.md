## Version 1.13.0 (2025-07-06) - 1.13.1 (2025-07-08)

### Editor
Does not require the .NET SDK for NuGet and Publish. If it isn't installed, automatically downloads (~26 MB) and uses a minimal SDK.

Removed the " C#" from the full name of the program. Now just "LibreAutomate".

Several improvements.

In 1.13.1 fixed bug in the LibreAutomate setup program: Windows UI shows two LibreAutomate programs installed.

### Library
No changes
