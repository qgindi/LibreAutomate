## Version 1.8.0 (2025-01-16)

### Editor
Can run on Windows ARM64.

Improved:
- Menu **File > Export, import > Export**: can include files specified in `/*/ c /*/` etc.
- If in `/*/ c /*/` etc used filename without path, and multiple files with the given filename exist in the workspace, can use the one from subfolders or ancestor folders (if single exists there). Previously would be error, unless one is in the same folder.

Fixed bugs:
- Git does not work when using the newest version of private Git.
- Image text incorrectly hidden in non-ASCII code.

### Library
Can be used on Windows ARM64.
