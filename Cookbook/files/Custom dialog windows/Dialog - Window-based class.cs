		//In your Window-based class you can override (replace) virtual functions of the Window class. 
		//Add a function with the same name, arguments, etc as a base's function, and with the override keyword. Then your function will be called instead of the base's function.
		//The code editor shows a list of overridable functions when you type the override keyword and space. Then you can start typing a function name to filter the list. Select a function. It inserts an empty function that just calls the base's function. Add more code before or/and after the call.
		//Usually a corresponding event exists. For example event Closed for function OnClosed. This function is called before event handlers.
		
		//Example of an override function. 
		protected override void OnClosed(EventArgs e) {
			print.it("closed");
			
			//Your function should call the base function. Unless its documentation says it isn't necessary or you want to steal the notification from the base class.
			//If a corresponding event exists, the base function usually raises the event (calls event handlers). For example base.OnClosed raises the Closed event.
