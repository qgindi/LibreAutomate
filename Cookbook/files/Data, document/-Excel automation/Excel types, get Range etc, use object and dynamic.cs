/// The mostly used Excel classes are in this simplified hierarchy:
/// <.x>Application<> - represents an Excel process. Contains workbooks.
/// . <.x>Workbook<> - represents an Excel file (<.c>.xlsx, .xls<>). Contains sheets (worksheets, charts, macros). Can have more than 1 window (the <.x>Window<> class). 
/// .. <.x>Worksheet<> - contains cells.
/// ... <.x>Range<> - represents 1 or more cells. You need it to get or set cell values etc.

/// This code gets objects of all these types in various ways.
