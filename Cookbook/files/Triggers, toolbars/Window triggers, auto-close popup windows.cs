/// To execute some code or run a script, can be used window <help Au.Triggers.ActionTriggers>triggers<>. For example auto-close popup window X whenever it appears.
///
/// To add a trigger can be used snippet <.x>triggerSnippet<> or <mono>Ctrl+Shift+Q<> or menu <b>TT > New trigger<>. Add triggers in function <.x>WindowTriggers<> in file <.c>Window triggers<>; you'll find examples there.
///

/// 
/// Click the <b>Run<> button to apply changes after editing.
/// 
/// Tips:
/// - Most window trigger parameters are the same as with <.x>wnd.find<>. To get window name etc can be used the <b>Find window<> tool or Quick capturing (<mono>Ctrl+Shift+Q<>).
/// - To get code for "run script" or "run/open file or URL" you can drag and drop scripts, files and links to the code editor.
/// 
/// See also recipe <+recipe>Triggers and toolbars<>.
///
/// Also triggers can be used in any script. For example in an <.c>.exe<> program that runs without the editor. <help Au.Triggers.ActionTriggers>Examples<>.
