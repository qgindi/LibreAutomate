/// COM component API often are declared in type libraries. In C# they can't be used directly, but the editor can convert a type library to a .NET assembly, and scripts can use the assembly instead. To convert, in the <b>Properties<> dialog click <b>COM<> or <b>...<> and select a type library.

/// Assume you want to use the shell type library in current script.
/// - Open the <b>Properties<> dialog.
/// - In the <b>Find in lists<> field type <.c>shell<> (optionally, just to make the list smaller).
/// - Click the <b>COM<> button. In the list select <b>Microsoft Shell Controls and Automation<>. It converts the COM type library to a .NET assembly.
/// - Click <b>OK<>. It adds a comment line like <.c>/*/ com Shell32 ...; /*/<> in the script.
/// - Below that line press <mono>Ctrl+Space<> and you'll see namespace <.c>Shell32<> added to the list. Use it like any other namespace.

/*/ com Shell32 1.0 #aab51e65.dll; /*/
using Shell32;

var shell = new Shell32.Shell();
shell.FileRun();
foreach (FolderItem v in shell.NameSpace(@"C:\").Items()) {
	print.it(v.Path);
}

/// Notes:
/// - To create objects, use interfaces (like <.c>Shell<> in the above example). Not classes like <.c>ShellClass<>.
/// - When converting a COM type library, may print several warnings <_>"can't convert..."</_>. Ignore them.
/// - When converting, may create several assembles. The <b>OK<> button adds them all to the script. One of them is the main; others are its dependencies and usually can be deleted from the script.
/// - In other scripts you can use the same .NET assembly (don't need to convert again). Either copy-paste the <.c>/*/ com Shell32 ...; /*/<>, or in the <b>Properties<> dialog click the <b>...<> button and select from submenu <b>Use converted<>. Or convert again, it does not harm.
/// - COM is an old technology. Some downloaded COM components may be 32-bit only. Script processes are 64-bit by default and can't use 32-bit dlls. To use 32-bit dlls, in the <b>Properties<> dialog select role <b>exeProgram<> and check <b>bit32<>.
