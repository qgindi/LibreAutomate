/*

Recipe "Automation code examples". Just examples of commonly used automation code, without much explanation. To show how an automation script looks.

CONSIDER: Recipe "Other C# features". Shortly about directives, disposing, reflection, attributes, inheritance, access, generic, dynamic, async, unsafe, span, range/index, interop, GC, module initializers, etc.

Create a video about all common and unique things this program can do. Toolbars, hotkeys, autotext, etc. Just what, not how. Or cookbook recipes, or scripts.

CONSIDER: Create a video tutorial about finding functions (intellisense).
	Now it's documented in web page "Code editor", and there is a link to it in intro recipe, but maybe boring to read.
