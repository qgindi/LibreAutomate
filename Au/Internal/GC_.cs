		//The above HandleCollectors are used by icon.
		//Tested, works well. But if threshold 100 or 200, GC become too frequent sometimes.
		//Default limit for USER and GDI objects is 10000, min 200.
		//Alternatively could use GC.AddMemoryPressure/GC.RemoveMemoryPressure.
		//	If we add 40000 bytes/icon and GC starts working when pressure is 4 MB, then the number of icons is ~100 and GDI handles ~300.
		//	Problem: the GC threshold for unmanaged memory pressure is unknown, undocumented and changing.
		//		Test results: used to be ~100 KB (why so small?), but now in .NET5 4MB (3MB in 32-bit process).
		//		For managed memory it is 2 MB.
		//		Could instead allocate managed array of this size and keep in a field.
		//			Info: System.Drawing.Icon objects loaded from file or stream keep icon memory in private readonly byte[]? _iconData.
		//				That is why it triggers GC quite soon. But eg Clone doesn't clone that memory and it can be dangerous.
		//Don't care about icon memory size.
