LibreAutomate is an automation library for Windows. Mostly desktop and web UI automation.

To get the most of it, install the [LibreAutomate](https://www.libreautomate.com/) app.

The host program should use a manifest like [this](https://github.com/qgindi/LibreAutomate/blob/master/_/default.exe.manifest). [More info](https://www.libreautomate.com/api/index.html).
